                    The utility company is responsible for ensuring heat delivery to approximately 1,600 buildings through a single district heating network. 
                    They generate heat using a combination of traditional heat-only boilers and combined heat and power (CHP) units, which produce both heat and electricity.

                        District heating is hot water from a power plant which is distributed to the buildings in a city through highly insulated pipes. In the buildings, the hot water is used for heating and for domestic hot water. 
                        The cooled water is then sent back to the plant, where it is reheated again. Image shows a small district heating grid with two heat producers.

                        The majority of the heat comes from cogeneration plants that produce both electricity and heat. 
                        The heat can be produced in many different ways and with different types of fuel, such as waste, gas, coal, and biomass. 
                        In addition, the industry's surplus heat, solar and geothermal heat,and large heat pumps as well as electric boilers are also used.
